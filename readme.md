This is a browser-based code repository visualization tool I've been hacking on in my spare time. It's implemented with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with Vite for bundling and a dev server. Currently, it's using GitHub's API for all the data, but maybe one day it will have it's own back-end.

## conventions

Throughout the source code, the contents of a directory (either subdirectories or files) are called `entries`. `tree` is also used to basically mean directory, and `blob` to mean file (as they're used in the GitHub API).
