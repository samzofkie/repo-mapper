1) Choose a repo
2) (Current) Bubble pages approach vs. bigger network / graph visualization
   - Log scaling of size
     - Explicit written size (? ex: 2.3MB) 
   - Arranging lettering to not be truncated
   - Color based on file extension (?) 
3) Navigation logic
   - (general visualization strategy)
   - Scroll?
   - Current path widget at top?
   - Keyboard driven navigation (?)
4) Code pages
   - Syntax highlighting
   - Row wrapping
   - Line numbering
5) `grep`ing
